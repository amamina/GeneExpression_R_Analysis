# GeneExpression_R_Analysis
Differential gene expression analysis using R on GEO datasets to identify highly dysregulated genes between case and control samples.
This project involves the analysis of gene expression data retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using R.  
The main objective was to identify significantly dysregulated genes between case and control samples in a selected dataset.  
By applying statistical and visualization approaches (such as volcano plots and heatmaps), this analysis highlights potential biomarkers or molecular signatures associated with the studied condition.

**Key Tools and Packages:**
- R (limma, GEOquery, ggplot2, pheatmap)
- GEO database (NCBI)
- Differential expression and visualization techniques

**Objectives:**
- Retrieve and preprocess GEO dataset  
- Identify up- and down-regulated genes  
- Visualize significant results through plots  

This project reflects my growing expertise in bioinformatics, data analysis, and molecular interpretation using real-world genomic datasets.
